637082749875134464	federer	1	All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
637492541969928192	federer	1	@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!

639589478638743552	federer	1	Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
639599584252166144	federer	1	Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!

641088714014347264	federer	1	I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
641089660849127424	federer	1	That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
